Test plugin

The completion status local plugin was a quick development.
-I tried to follow the brief as accurately as possible
-The list of users does not take into consideration any pagination
-I used the Order By to sort by course name as this was a test. Normally this is inefficient and can affect performance and it would normally be done ater the results are returned
-The code checker was used but still saying that white space is added but used for formatting
-I did not use enrol_get_all_users_courses() but did my own query to get the completions at the same time. Could have used the completion class but for a test this was done.
-Used git to make some changes as per the requirements to show the use of git
